http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_cache

* What?
A web cache is a mechanism for the temporary storage (caching) of web documents,
such as HTML pages and images, to reduce bandwidth usage, server load, and
perceived lag. A web cache stores copies of documents passing through it;
subsequent requests may be satisfied from the cache if certain conditions are
met.


* Cache control
HTTP defines three basic mechanisms for controlling caches: freshness, validation, and invalidation.

** Freshness 
allows a response to be used without re-checking it on the origin server, and
can be controlled by both the server and the client. For example, the Expires
response header gives a date when the document becomes stale, and the
Cache-Control: max-age directive tells the cache how many seconds the response
is fresh for.

** Validation 
can be used to check whether a cached response is still good after it becomes
stale. For example, if the response has a Last-Modified header, a cache can make
a conditional request using the If-Modified-Since header to see if it has
changed. The ETag (entity tag) mechanism also allows for both strong and weak
validation.

** Invalidation 
is usually a side effect of another request that passes through the cache. For
example, if a URL associated with a cached response subsequently gets a POST,
PUT or DELETE request, the cached response will be invalidated.

** Expiration-based caching
< 200 OK
< Content-Type: text/html
< Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=600
< ....
Pros:
+ Simple
+ No contact with server until expiration
Cons:
- Inefficient
- Difficult to manage


** Validation-based caching
< 200 OK
< ETag: "686897696a7c876b7e"
> GET /example
> If-None-Match: "686897696a7c876b7e"
< 304 Not Modified
Pros:
+ Reduces bandwidth
+ Ensures freshness
Cons:
- Server handling every request
- Generating 304 still costs processing and I/O

** Expiration+Validation caching
< 200 OK
< ETag: "686897696a7c876b7e"
< Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=600
Pros:
+ Expiration reduces contact with server
+ Validation reduces bandwidth
Cons:
- "Worst case" inefficiency
- Still managing caching rules
