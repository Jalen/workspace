* Debug Tips
** Add the 'debugger;' to the script file

The 'debugger' will introduce a breakpoint when the file is lanched. Then attach
the eclipse to the node.js application. This is a must have when you want to set
breapoint on your script since your script will be compiled when it get
executed. And when it hitted, you can set the breakpoint.
