So being out of touch lately, I realized that there were Python packages that were best installed via eggs and/or the Python Cheese Shop. Being clueless about it all, I managed to get it working (in Ubuntu) fairly easily using the following method:

    Install the python-setuptools package either via the Synaptic Package Manager or just:sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
    Then you can use: sudo easy_install packagename

It really doesn¡¯t get much easier than that. I guess I just have been in the
dark because the major packages I use have debian packages maintained for
Ubuntu. But this essentially is an apt-get for Python packages maintained via
the Cheese Shop. Mostly, I just wanted to document the Ubuntu part of it while
also proving how out of touch I am with the Python community¡­ at least with
regard to certain things.
