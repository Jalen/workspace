Beginning of the PowerShell Script

* What?

Windows PowerShell is Microsoft's task automation framework, consisting of a
command-line shell and associated scripting language built on top of, and
integrated with the .NET Framework. PowerShell provides full access to COM and
WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and
remote Windows systems.

Check [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_PowerShell][wiki]] for more information.

* Learn it

To learn it, I download a PowerShell cheat sheet, it is very clear to tell out
what this language is designed as.

* Use Windows PowerShell ISE

The Windows PowerShell ISE is shipped with PowerShell, you can find it in the
start menu list. When it is running, it is looks like this:

And with it, you can run and debug your script. When the bp is hit, you can
inspect your variable by moving mouse on the variable or type the variable in
command panel.

It is very useful to use 'Get-Member' CmdLet to inspect the type and avaible
members of the variable.
