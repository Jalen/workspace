Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) offers a reliable, highly scalable,
hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. By using
Amazon SQS, developers can simply move data between distributed components of
their applications that perform different tasks, without losing messages or
requiring each component to be always available. Amazon SQS makes it easy to
build an automated workflow, working in close conjunction with the Amazon
Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and the other AWS infrastructure web
services.


Amazon SQS works by exposing Amazon¡¯s web-scale messaging infrastructure as a
web service. Any computer on the Internet can add or read messages without any
installed software or special firewall configurations. Components of
applications using Amazon SQS can run independently, and do not need to be on
the same network, developed with the same technologies, or running at the same
time.


- Reliable

  Amazon SQS runs within Amazon¡¯s high-availability data centers, so queues
  will be available whenever applications need them. To prevent messages from
  being lost or becoming unavailable, all messages are stored redundantly across
  multiple servers and data centers.

- Simple

  Developers can get started with Amazon SQS by using only five APIs:
  CreateQueue, SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, ChangeMessageVisibility, and
  DeleteMessage. Additional APIs are available to provide advanced
  functionality.
